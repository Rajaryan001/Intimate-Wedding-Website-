            <p class="story-paragraph">
                Neither of them believed in online dating. She did it on a dare; he was just curious. Through digital or divine intervention, their lines crossed and they swiped right at the right time.<br><br>
                When the pandemic made it impossible to meet up, online dating helped romance bloom. They became fast friends and loving partners despite the distance. When they finally met in person 6 months later, Matt already had the ring with him. Dani said yes! The rest is history, and you get to be a part of it.
